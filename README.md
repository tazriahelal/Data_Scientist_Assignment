## N.B: - For part-2 I used Python3 version
Have to install these libraries(Numpy, Pandas,scipy)
    
               pip install numpy
               pip install scipy
               pip install pandas

## Part 1: Here I created a pivot table using data of sheet1 & shoed the information following this structure -

a. The data table showed as the Sum of Income as value.

b. The columns is included as the value of Gender and MaritalStatus.

c. The rows is in the following order: Division; Customer Name; ID.

d. In sheet2 there are some IDs. Added a new column to sheet1 and name it
“Matched”. Here I have shown the IDs of sheet2 with the IDs of sheet1 and showing
the result as True or False Using Formula


### Note: Added additional sheets which filter the data of sheet1 & filtered by Division parameters.

## Part 2:

2. Converted the excel file to csv.
3. Loaded the csv file.
4. Get rid of the column ID from the data frame.
5. Encoded the data to have similar values.
6. Useing K-means clustering based on their divisions.
7. Submitting the file without omitting the output.
